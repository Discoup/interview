# Frontend Challenge

Consider the header on this page and especially the "Bare Metal & VPS" dropdown menu: https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/

Build a simple page containing a dropdown menu with the following features:
- By hovering on the menu item called "Shows", it should load data from https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=space

A list of show names appears on the left. By clicking on one of them, it should load details about that show on the right: the show url, the show summary, an image if available and the genres.

Please use vanilla JS, no external frameworks. Publish a single HTML file wherever you want (Github, CodePen..). We should be able to run it just by opening it in a browser.
We're more interested in the interactions, not so much about the graphics, so don't worry about that.
